# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Habit Builder is a web app that helps you track your efforts in building new habits through one simple metric: time! Users can create tasks for the app to track, and then time their sessions through a simple stopwatch interface. Habit Builder saves this data, and will provide visualization so you can see how well you meet your goals. I am developing this because I wanted a simple, fast way to track the time I spend writing and coding. 
### Features
 - Robust security and authentication through Spring Security
 - Users can create tasks to be tracked and set intended to daily and weekly goals
 - Simple stopwatch interface that times and stores the length of practice/work sessions
 - Data visualizations/line charts that display your progress on tasks and whether you are meeting your goals
 - (Reach goal) Android app version

### Technologies
 - Java
 - Thymeleaf
 - Spring MVC
 - Spring Security
 - Spring JPA/Hibernate
 - Javascript
 - Chart.js
 - JSON


### What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn how to utilize, configure, and implement Spring Security and authentication. In order to create the stopwatch I had to learn some basic javascript and learn how javascript interacts with thymeleaf. In order to record, persist, and retrieve the timed sessions I had to learn a lot about Java's time libraries and how to work with them. In order to create the visualization I'm using an open source software called Chart.js, which has forced me to understand Java dependencies better. More critically, I have to figure out how to send my persisted data to the javascript, which I believe will require me to learn some JSON.
